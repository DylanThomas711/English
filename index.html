         <h1>Troys dream came true in terms of Cory. After refusing to send him to college for football where Troy believed Cory would be crushed and rejected, Cory decided to persue a very different career, that still used similar skills to the ones he would have used in football, joining the marines. This field provided him with a stable and honorable income so that when he does have a family he will be able to provide as well if not better than his father was able to.</h1>

         <h1>His dream did not come true when it came to Lyons. Troys was not there for Lyons childhood, so it would be harder to convince him to take a stable and "safe" path in life rather than music. Because of this, Lyons never learned what Cory did, and eventually ended up in jail.</h1>
